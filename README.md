The project "Exploring the Loan Eligibility Prediction Model" is the third project undertaken by the Future Interns team. The project involves building a model that predicts the eligibility of loan applicants based on various factors.

The first step in the project is data preparation, where the team cleaned and normalized the data, handled missing values, and converted categorical variables to ensure a well-balanced model. This step is crucial in ensuring that the data used in the model is accurate and reliable.

The second step is exploratory data analysis, where the team used cross-tabulations, histograms, and box plots to reveal patterns in applicant income, loan amounts, and credit history. This step helps the team to understand the distribution of the data and identify any potential issues or biases in the data.

The third step involves building machine learning models to predict loan eligibility. The team used three different models: a decision tree classifier, a naive bayes classifier, and clustering with KMeans. The decision tree classifier is a simple and effective model that can handle both categorical and continuous variables. The naive bayes classifier is a probabilistic model that assumes independence between the features. The clustering with KMeans algorithm is a unsupervised learning algorithm that groups similar data points together.

The final step is to evaluate the performance of the models and select the best one for predicting loan eligibility. The team used various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score to compare the performance of the models.

Overall, the project aims to develop a robust and accurate model that can predict loan eligibility based on various factors, which can be used by financial institutions to improve their loan approval processes.[loan.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17844483/loan.csv)
